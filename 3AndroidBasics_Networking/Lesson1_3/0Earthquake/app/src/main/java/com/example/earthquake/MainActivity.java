    //JSON = JavaScript Object Notation [parsing is done in order to make a java object from simple text in json similar to Integer.parseInt(String s)]
    //JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of
    //attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays. It is a common data format with diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers.

    //API is the acronym for Application Programming  Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
    //Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.
    //In android studio parsing is done using JSONObject class.It uses format similar to tree structure.Example:-

    //So in layman words, it's the app way of saying that if you want to build something new using some of our data/functionality we can work it together.
    //It's like a programming partnership.
